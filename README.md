# VideoSync
Syncronize your videos with friends ! Watch together and have fun!
This project is designed to syncronize a same video in multiple local direcotries.

It is built by Visual Studio 2010, written in C#,
so you will need to install .NET 4.0 first.

The program is highly bundled with the video player,
because we used hot keys to control the video player like a black box.
Currently, we support only "PotPlayer" as the video player.
