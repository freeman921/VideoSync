# VideoSync
Syncronize your videos with friends ! Watch together and have fun!
This project is designed to syncronize a same video in multiple local direcotries.

# What you need first
1. .NET Framework
It is built by Visual Studio 2010, written in C#,
so you will need to install .NET 4.0 first.

2. Daum Potplayer
The program is highly bundled with the video player,
because we used hot keys to control the video player as a black box.
Currently, we support only "PotPlayer" as the video player.
